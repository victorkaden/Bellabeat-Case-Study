# Bellabeat Case Study

### **Objective**
This case study analyzes smart device usage data to uncover trends and provide actionable recommendations for Bellabeat, a health-focused tech company.

---

### **Dataset Overview**
The dataset contains data on user activity, including metrics such as steps, calories burned, and sleep duration, collected from smart devices.

---

### **Methods Used**
#### SQL
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized column names.
- **Aggregations**: Calculated averages for user activity metrics (e.g., daily steps and calories burned).
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Identified top active days and grouped data by time (weekdays vs. weekends).

#### R
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaned and organized data using `tidyverse` functions like `mutate()` and `filter()`.
- **Visualization**: Created graphs with `ggplot2` to identify key trends (e.g., Steps vs. Calories Burned).
- **Statistical Analysis**: Measured correlations between activity metrics.

---

### **Key Insights**
1. Users are most active during weekdays, with a 30% higher activity level compared to weekends.
2. Sleep duration trends suggest users average 6.8 hours of sleep, below the recommended 7â€“9 hours for optimal health.
3. Caloric burn peaks in the morning hours, aligning with user fitness routines.

---

### **Recommendations**
- Introduce personalized weekday workout plans to maximize engagement.
- Develop reminders for improving sleep hygiene based on user patterns.
- Create morning workout challenges to leverage peak activity times.
